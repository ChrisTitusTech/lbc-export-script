# What is this?
This is a simple shell script I created to automate the tedious process of moving my LBRY Credits from my vidoes into my wallet.

# Why is this?
Beacuse I'm lazy and I export credits a lot... and the manual process I used to follow used to take literal hours.

# How do I use this?
Run `lbc.sh` from your terminal. The script will ask if you want to export your credits (defaults to YES). You agree to suffer the consequences of this.

# What do I need to use this?
You need to have the `lbrynet` command available. If you installed LBRY through the AUR, you'll probably want to link `/opt/LBRY/resources/static/daemon/lbrynet` to `/usr/local/bin/` or something before running this script.

# What happens if something goes wrong?

Use of this script is entirely on you. I wrote this script for my own purposes, but it comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTEE
